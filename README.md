## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v22.15.1 or later recommended)
*   npm (v10.9.2 or later)
*   Firebase CLI (for deployment): `npm install -g firebase-tools`

### Project Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd gig-connect-client
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the `gig-connect-client` directory and add the necessary environment variables. At a minimum, you'll need to configure the connection to your backend API:
    ```env
    VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api/v1 # Or your deployed backend URL
    ```
    You will also need to configure your Firebase project credentials for client-side Firebase SDK initialization. These are typically stored in a Firebase configuration object within your application code (e.g., in a `firebase.config.js` file that is imported) and are safe to include in client-side code.

### Running the Project (Development)

To start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev

```
The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Deployment

This project is configured for deployment using Firebase Hosting.

1.  **Build the project for production:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    
    ```
    This will create a `dist` folder with the optimized static assets.

2.  **Deploy to Firebase:**
    Ensure you are logged into Firebase (`firebase login`) and have initialized Firebase in your project (`firebase init hosting` if you haven't already, selecting the `dist` directory as your public directory).
    ```bash
    firebase deploy --only hosting
    ```
